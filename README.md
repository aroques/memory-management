## Memory Management

**OSS (operating system similator)** is a program that simulates an operating system.

This program simulates how a Operating System mangages memory.

The second chance page replacement algorithm is used.

To build this program run:
```
make
```

To run this program:
```    
./oss [-n number of max concurrent children processes]
```
The -n flag is optional. The default number of max concurrent children processes is 8.

To cleanup run:
```

```
